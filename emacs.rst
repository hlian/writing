*some sort of salvation from the mistakes of today*

I have been using Emacs since I was seventeen years old â€“ thirteen years. I have run my configuration files on dozens of computer boxes. My config files started as a Subversion repository, and then Mercurial, and now Git. The initial files were written on Windows, but they primarily run on macOS today. They are not behemoth, consisting of fewer than 1000 lines, thanks  to the healthy ecosystem of libraries and tools that exist today. (But more on that later.)
