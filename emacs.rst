*some sort of salvation from the mistakes of today*

.. classes: first

I have been using Emacs since I was seventeen years old â€“ thirteen years. I have run my configuration files on dozens of computer boxes. My config files started as a Subversion repository, and then Mercurial, and now Git. The initial files were written on a Lenovo Windows laptop, but they primarily run on macOS desktops, laptops, and Hackintoshes today.

The core of Emacs is Emacs Lisp, a charming, homoiconic interpreted language. Most of the actions you can take in Emacs are functions in Emacs Lisp; in that sense, Emacs is a small feat of wonder. You can use Emacs to edit Emacs, much like the robot that performs surgery on its own brain in Ted Chiang's "Exhalation." My config files, then, a small percentage of all the Emacs Lisp code I am running at any one point. Over time, the files grew to incorporate more features and keybindings, but largely stayed around the same file size (<200 lines of code), thanks to the healthy ecosystem of libraries and tools that exist for Emacs users today.

When I use other people's text editors, I feel lost. My fingers stumble, their muscle memory telling them to hit key chords that are not there. They are homesick.
