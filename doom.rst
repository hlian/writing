This file, `doom-emacs/modules/lang/markdown/config.el <https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/7ed9ee2ae5b66ecd8c0fe77aa5c6456c1b749ba5/modules/lang/markdown/config.el>`_, perfectly encapsulates why I regret my not switching to some sort of Emacs configuration framework earlier, abandoning the dozens of years I spent as a Emacs configuration minimalist. I would never spend an entire afternoon finding the right Markdown package to ``use-package`` and the right CSS to inject into the ``<head>`` tag, because how often am I editing Markdown?

(Markdown is an unextensible, but extremely popular, markup language, about which the best thing you can say is that there are a bunch of implementations, some of which agree with one another. Nothing in the way of directives (ReST) or macros (LaTeX) or elegance (Lisp), just a quick way to bold and italicize text.)

But someone else did, or some *group* else did, and I get to take advantage of it. All I hit is ``<leader> m p``, and I get a nice tab in my browser with Markdown compiled to HTML and all the code blocks syntax-highlighted.

Thanks, Doom Emacs. I'm sorry I was so stubborn, all these years.

Thoom Emacs.
